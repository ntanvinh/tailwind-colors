A small utility to get tailwind color scheme in case you need to work with other css styling tool such as styled
component, inline style...
I've found it very useful in my projects, so I hope you found it useful too.

Example:

- twRgb("slate-900") ~ **rgb(15 23 42)**,
- twRgba("slate-900", 10) ~ **rgba(15,23,42,10)**
